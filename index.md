    Lab 1 ultimately was a great lab for me. It opened the door for me in the world of computer science, and coding. 
    Lab 1's hello world code was the intro code, and I liked how looking back on it now, it is a very simple code 
    but at the start of the semester I struggled so much to even get into the file and beginning my code. 
    It taught me and my peers the tools that we'd be using for the rest of the semester, like GitHub and VS 
    Code. I struggled but I ultimately figured it out with the help of my instructors and looking back on it 
    it is a good memory to have.

    Lab 2 was a good entry lab into actual programming. It introduced a fun topic, about viral math problems 
    that have been notorious on the internet while combining it with basic intializing skills. In part 2, it stepped
    things up a bit by having us do madlibs. I enjoyed it as well because madlibs are pretty fun 
    and it was a bit of a challenge at first, having to do tons of cout statements and working with strings. 
    It was overall a good lab, because it had a mix of both worlds. Numbers in part 1, and actual words in part 2.

    Lab 3 had 2 parts as well, every lab after part 2 began to have 2 parts. I enjoyed part 1, which contained 
    a program that calculated the dollar per square inch of a pizza, otherwise known as the pizza unit price. This program was also fun because it built on the skills of lab 2 part 1 where we were working with viral math problems, such as division and multiplication operations. Along with this, part 1 of lab 3 introduced working with a new data type, double, which works better with division. Part 2 contained a bit of a harder program, it was more of a challenge. It had us calculate the difference of 2 dates, using the JulianDay function. It was a challenge figuring out how to get the julian day function to work, but other than that it was a fun program to work with and is a handy program to have.

    Lab 4 was the first lab to include a functions file, along with a header file. At first this confused me, but once I asked for clarification from my TA it helped me traverse through the new files, that would affect me later on in the new labs. I liked that this lab included the new files, as it is more efficient to have a separate function so everything is not cluttered on one file, making it easier for others to read the code. The functions file allowed for us to work with variables that have initialized values and showed me how it transferred over to the main .cc file. Part 2 of lab 4 introduced if statements, which were a challenge to traverse at first. However, they're ultimately so useful so I am grateful that I was able to work through part 2 of this lab, because these if statements are very basic so they were a great interest. The if statements are something that I enjoyed because they make things more concise and allow for our codes to do even more, expanding our ability to be creative and create even more than we possibly imagined. As someone who is barely learning to code this semester, it blew my mind.

    Lab 5 part 1 was one that was a simple one. The program expected us to work with multiple files, defining functions and using unit tests that were instructor given. The goal was to write a program that could take two integers as a command line argument representing the length and width of a positive area rectangle. Something I enjoyed from part 1 was how simple it truly was, thanks to the if statement we use to make sure that we are only calculating a positive area rectangle. Without the if statement, it would make things a bit more difficult but I am glad that we were able to ensure it was positive with an if statement. Part 2 required us to use conversions of 12 inches to a foot, and then 8 eighth of an inch in every inch. Along with this, the program must work well with positive and negative values. One thing I enjoyed about this part of the lab was that we used TruncateDouble in order to cut the number's decimal part and then doing static cast to keep the integer part of the number constant.

    Lab 7 part 1 was similar to lab 3, but lab 7's part 1 is an updated one. Like lab 3, the goal is to calculate the date difference between 2 dates. However, this time around instead of using std::cin, we input the date within the command line, which alters the code a bit but it ultimately ends up in the same result. Something which I enjoyed from this lab was updating the code we used in lab 3, because the output of our code feels more concise, there are less words in the final output at the end of the code, so it felt more efficient to me. Part 2 asked us to code using functions which were based on street names. These street names had restrictions onto when people were allowed to park their vehicles, so we had to take this into account when coding this. What I liked about this code was the amount of if statements that were in it, I struggled with all of the if statements but I feel like it ultimately taught me how to debug better because I had to fix these statements in order to get the code correct.

    Lab 6 had 2 parts as well, part 1's objective was to have us work with mad libs once again, which was fun. The program asked us write a program which fills in the blank in a sentence about a sandwich order. This part had us use command line arguments for each fill in the blank in the sentence that the user was supposed to put in the command line. The command line argument is picked up using the arguments.at command which we first used in this lab. Later on in other labs, we use these commands as well for other labs that use command line arguments. One thing I enjoy about this part of the program is that this is where we first began to use vectors in order to implement our code. In part 2 of this lab, our goal was to validate the number of arguments, validate what is in the argument, calculate the total score of the blackjack card, and then print the score using std::cout. What I enjoyed most about this part of the lab was all of the if statements we had to apply. I also liked that we were using blackjack as an example to improve our understanding of the if statements, it got complicated sometimes trying to implement the ace which can either be a value of 11 or 1 depending on your other card, but once I figured out I felt very good about it that my partner and I were able to code through it.
