### CPSC 120

* Reflection 1: 

    * Lab 1
    Lab 1 ultimately was a great lab for me. It opened the door for me in the world of computer science, and coding. 
    Lab 1's hello world code was the intro code, and I liked how looking back on it now, it is a very simple code 
    but at the start of the semester I struggled so much to even get into the file and beginning my code. 
    It taught me and my peers the tools that we'd be using for the rest of the semester, like GitHub and VS 
    Code. I struggled but I ultimately figured it out with the help of my instructors and looking back on it 
    it is a good memory to have.
